# chesscpp
This project is an implementation of a game of chess in C++ using SDL as a graphics library.
So far, the graphics and some underlying game logic is implemented, but gameplay is yet to be established:
  - SDL and other libraries are initialised.
  - Sets of pieces are created, with an associated bitboard and image
  - The board and pieces are rendered using this piece set information
