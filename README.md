# chesscpp
This project is an implementation of a game of chess in C++ using SDL as a graphics library.
So far, the graphics and some underlying game logic is implemented, but gameplay is yet to be established:
  - SDL and other libraries are initialised.
  - Sets of pieces are created, with an associated bitboard and image
  - The board and pieces are rendered using this piece set information

The next steps will be to implement game logic, calculate possible moves, and allow the user to select and move pieces.
