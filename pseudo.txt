Create a function to convert FEN to bitsets
- Take a FEN string as input
- Separate the string into its constituent parts (one function)
- Convert the first parts to bitboards

- | these together to create bitboards of each colour
- | these two together to create a final bitboard of everything on the board

Considerations:
- How many classes would I need for this? Maybe just one - a BoardPieces class, inheriting from the BoardVariables struct (?)
- The BoardPieces would contain a number of arrays, initialised as 64 bit unsigned integers
- How would I then connect this to the GUI?

- Need to untangle all of the inheritance especially around Pieces
- Reversible moves are any move made by a piece other than a pawn, and contribute to the fifty-move rule
